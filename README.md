This app is designed to help medical professionals keep track of patient interactions. By recording medical events such as starting CPR, delivering shocks, and administering medications, it allows medical professionals to focus on saving lives, without needing to focus on remembering what happened and when. It even provides a handy metronome to keep CPR on a steady rhythm.

Written in React Native, this app is accessible on Apple and Android devices through the Expo Go app, and will be published on the app stores in the near future. Check it out [here](https://snack.expo.dev/@elld/nch-app-demo), or watch the [video demo](https://youtu.be/aG9tURyVxC4).
